# codingQuiz

Short coding quiz. I was able to add functionality to the buttons, apply correct or incorrect classes and award points based on them. I created a timer that counts down
and if you run out of time you are taken to the end screen. Your score is saved in local storage and you are taken to the end.html where you have the option to play again.

I was not able to get the save high scores functionality to work. I went ahead and included a text box for entering your name, as well as being unable to click the box if you
haven't put anything into the display field.
